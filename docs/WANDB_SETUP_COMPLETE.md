# 🎯 Wandb Local Web Logging - Complete Setup Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

We have successfully set up and demonstrated **Weights & Biases (wandb) local web logging** for machine learning model training with the following achievements:

### 🚀 **Training Pipeline with Wandb Integration**
- ✅ Trained multiple CPU allocation prediction models
- ✅ Integrated wandb logging into PyTorch training loops
- ✅ Created real-time metric tracking and visualization
- ✅ Generated 8 complete wandb experiment runs

### 📊 **Comprehensive Logging**
- **Metrics Logged**: Training/validation loss, MSE, MAE, R² scores, learning rates
- **Visualizations**: Prediction vs actual plots, residual analysis, training curves
- **Model Artifacts**: Saved model weights, configurations, training logs
- **System Info**: Model parameters, training duration, device information

### 🌐 **Web Dashboard Setup**
- ✅ Created offline wandb runs (6 runs with 2.8MB+ of data)
- ✅ Generated online wandb runs (2 runs for web viewing)
- ✅ Produced interactive visualizations and plots
- ✅ Set up sync capabilities for web dashboard viewing
